4. Drivers can misbehave if they are running when an interrupt happens
5. The delta in figure 1 refers to the time difference between when a thread tells the action to be scheduled and when the action actually occurs
6. Cyclictest is a test that measures the delta between when a thread starts an action vs when it wants to turn on to start an action
7. The plot in figure 2 is a plot of the PREEMPT_RT patch in a main kernel. 
8. Dispatch latency is the amount of time that a system takes to respond to a request for a process to begin operation.
	Scheduling latency is the amount of time that it takes for the cpu to start the action after it has been scheduled
