### Watch
1. Julia Cartwright works at national instruments
2. PREEMT_RT is a kernel patch to Linux that allows it to work with real-time capabilities. 
3. Mixed Criticality refers to when there are two tasks running simultaneously that need to interact with each other, with both having differing levels of real-time sensitivity
4. Drivers can misbehave if they are running when an interrupt happens
5. The delta in figure 1 refers to the time difference between when a thread tells the action to be scheduled and when the action actually occurs
6. Cyclictest is a test that measures the delta between when a thread starts an action vs when it wants to turn on to start an action
7. The plot in figure 2 is a plot of the PREEMPT_RT patch in a main kernel. 
8. Dispatch latency is the amount of time that a system takes to respond to a request for a process to begin operation.
	Scheduling latency is the amount of time that it takes for the cpu to start the action after it has been scheduled
9. Mainline
10. The irq needs to finish executing before the external event can start
